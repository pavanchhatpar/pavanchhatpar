### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate from Northeastern University, with a Master's Degree in Computer Science specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
<br/><br/>
Currently, I work at Honeywell, where I help various internal business groups solve their problems using Data Science. As a part of the Data Science team, I promote best practices in Data Science development.
<br/><br/>
I have a keen interest in research topics related to NLP and Deep Learning. I explain concepts to myself by coding the methods proposed in various research papers.
