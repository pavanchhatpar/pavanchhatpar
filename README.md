### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I work at Honeywell, where I contribute in developing production ready ML models for products powered by Data Science. As part of the Data Science team, I promote best practices in Data Science development focusing on reducing the gap between experimentation and deployment.
<br/><br/>
I graduated from Northeastern University, with a Master's Degree in Computer Science specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
<br/><br/>
I have a keen interest in research topics related to NLP and Deep Learning. I explain concepts to myself by coding the methods proposed in various research papers.
<br/><br/>
âš¡ Fun fact: As an undergrad student I wanted to learn android development and also find time to learn it, so I built an app that planned my leaves in school to never show up on the low attendance radar
