### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at Northeastern University. I'm working towards my Master's degree in Computer Science specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
<br/><br/>
Currently, I'm walking into my last semester of grad school. I did Data Science internships at Honeywell and Wayfair while enrolled in grad school, where I contributed to projects using NLP and Survival Analysis using Deep Learning.
<br/><br/>
Outside of internships and curriculum, I have a keen interest in research topics related to NLP and Deep Learning; I'm open to collaborations on any of these topics.
